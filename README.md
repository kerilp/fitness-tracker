# NoSQL Fitness Tracker

A fitness tracker that uses Express.js, MongoDB, and starter code to allow users to tracker their exercise routines. Users are able to view, create, and track daily workouts. They can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, users can also track distance traveled.
